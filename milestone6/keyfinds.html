Finding silver quarters is easier than many people think, and they still show up in circulation today—especially in bank rolls. All Washington quarters dated 1932 through
 1964 are made of 90% silver, so the fastest way to spot one is simply by checking the date. Silver quarters also have a distinct look: the edge of the coin will appear solid white,
  unlike modern quarters which have a brown copper stripe along the edge. Silver coins are also slightly heavier and make a sharper, higher-pitched sound when dropped compared to the
   duller “thunk” of clad coins. The best places to search include bank rolls, old coin jars, estate sales, and pocket change from cash-heavy businesses. With enough searching and patience,
    finding silver quarters is still very possible—and very rewarding for collectors.</p>
