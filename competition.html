        <h2>How will I do better than the websites I am competing with?</h2>
        <h4>No Ads</h4>
        <p>This website will be 100% ad free! Many, if not all, of the websites like mine have lots of advertisements
            filling up
            the enire page and causing it to be hard to read the content you came to the site for. Not only that, but it
            can also
            make the page load slowly and even make you forget what you were even doing. This site will have zero ads,
            so you can
            read and understand it easier.</p>
        <h4>Easy Explanations for Beginners</h4>
        <p>One thing competing websites are doing right is making the information easy to understand and to follow,
            making it
            more beginner-friendly. I plan to keep this up by making all of my information plain and easily followed,
            even for
            those just starting out.</p>
        <h4>Pictures</h4>
        <p>While many sites are really good at using high quality and good-looking pictures, some still have
            low-quality,
            grainy photos that are hard to look at. I plan to always use high quality photos so that everyone can have a
            clearer image of the subject at hand.</p>
